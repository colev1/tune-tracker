## Assignment: 
The goal is to build a responsive web app using react/redux, node and graphql [if new to graphql then don’t use it] that makes an http call to any feed provider [twitter, linkedIn, bureau of labor statistics, anything for that matter] to pull the data and displays it on 2 breakpoints [desktop and mobile]. This application should be packaged to deploy with 1click using node. Feel free to get creative, if you want to use any ORM and store data in database - go for it BUT not a must have. Please organize your code structure, so it’s easier to follow through and configurable to make needed changes along the path of deployment in real life.
